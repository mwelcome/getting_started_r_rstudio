# Purpose and target group
Script to follow along on session "Introduction to R."

This tutorial is aimed at anyone with no experience with R as well as no programming experience in general. 
It is a very beginner friendly session breaking down the intial steps on how to get started. 

Things to notice as someone completely new to programming:
The file-path has to be adapted to your working directory. 
Anything in brackets like this "< ... >" means that you have to replace it with your own file path.
